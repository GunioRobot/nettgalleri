<h2>Omtaler</h2>
<p>Fire falling from the sky<br />
Rage of god is coming down<br />
Armageddon's drawing nigh<br />
Sinner cry! Heathen die!<br />
Hear the toll of pain, gloria, gloria<br />
In the fiery rain<br />
Fire falling from the sky<br />
Rage of god is coming down<br />
Armageddon's drawing nigh<br />
Sinner cry! Heathen die!<br />
Hear the toll of pain, gloria, gloria</p>

<p>Now the time has come, the end's begun<br />
And the only one will come</p>

<p>It has been foretold<br />
By the visions of the old<br />
And the madness in their eyes<br />
Said his angel will arise<br />
That's what they know: Holy Lord it's over, oh god<br />
We have done no wrong<br />
So we go where we belong<br />
To the neverending dream<br />
But for those who lived in sin<br />
They claim to know: Holy Lord it's over oh god</p>

<p>Hey Angel, can you tell me<br />
Will you lead us to the place<br />
Full of heat, in the fire<br />
For we only brought disgrace</p>

<p>He is not the one. If they only knew</p>

<p>Hey Angel, will you take us<br />
To the judgement of his rage<br />
Hey will we die<br />
For we couldn't close the gate</p>

<p>To the knowledge as they have been told</p>

<p>I don't know how could I prove<br />
Nothing but the cloven hoof<br />
Reigning over them as well<br />
While they keep on fighting hell<br />
Babylon the scarlet whore has come</p>

<p>We are the seven, judgement of heaven<br />
Why don't we know: We are the angels<br />
It's revelation, soul castigation<br />
Fire will burn us away<br />
We are the seven, judgement of heaven<br />
Why don't we know: We are the angels<br />
It's revelation, soul castigation<br />
Fire will burn us away</p>

<p>Redeemer, devastation<br />
Hope it only has been ment<br />
For the sin of the dreamer<br />
Who broke the law you'd sent</p>

<p>He is not the one. If they only knew</p>

<p>Hey, don't know but I wondered:<br />
When we lost the seal again<br />
Maybe stoned by the incense<br />
Do we rise or just descent</p>

<p>He is not the one. If they only knew</p>

<p>I don't know how could I prove<br />
Nothing but the cloven hoof<br />
Reigning over them as well<br />
While they keep on fighting hell<br />
Babylon the scarlet whore has come</p>

<p>We are the seven, judgement of heaven<br />
Why don't we know: We are the angels<br />
It's revelation, soul castigation<br />
Fire will burn us away<br />
We are the seven, judgement of heaven<br />
Why don't we know: We are the angels<br />
It's revelation, soul castigation<br />
Fire will burn us away</p>

<p>Woe to you longing for the wisdom<br />
Woe to you longing for the light<br />
All my sons bring me back what is mine<br />
Or you'll end burning in this night<br />
Woe to you longing for the wisdom<br />
Woe to you longing for the light<br />
All my sons bring me back what is mine<br />
Or you'll end burning in this night</p>

<p>Once I have been lost in what they told me to believe<br />
Until I felt it burning deep inside to set my spirit free<br />
And I escaped to another world to help the little men<br />
Who make me plunge into philosophy – to feel my mind again...<br />
No one left to hold me tight – on the ‘real' other side – but her in chains</p>

<p>I had been alone till the madman came along<br />
With the knowledge and silver long beard<br />
He was the first man ever teaching how I could be free<br />
Helping me to find -oh- the mind and the soul<br />
They've been trying to hide it away...<br />
And he promised we'd help Anna if I'd help him to go all the way</p>

<p>Go all the way into the world of minds<br />
Open the gate and do not close behind<br />
Prevent them from hiding the light away<br />
Prevent them from tellin' us tales<br />
Or at the end of all they scare us with will be a million empty brains...</p>

<p>I could bring what you told me<br />
The seal they need to close the gate forever<br />
But still I haven't found a meaning<br />
Anna will we ever be together</p>

<p>You've been fighting for your soul<br />
And sometimes it takes a toll<br />
Hope one day you'll understand<br />
What it means to hold in hands<br />
What they call a fantasy<br />
It is nothing but a key<br />
To the world that now you're in<br />
That they call a wicked dream</p>

<p>When you're walking on your own<br />
when you're broken and alone<br />
You may feel us from inside –<br />
on the other side of life<br />
Ohohohoh...</p>

<p>I've been fighting for my soul<br />
And sometimes it takes a toll<br />
Hope one day we'll understand<br />
What it means to hold in hands<br />
What we call a fantasy<br />
But it's nothing but a key<br />
To the world that now I'm in<br />
That we call a wicked dream</p>

<p>Oh, walking on my own<br />
When I'm broken and alone<br />
I may feel you from inside<br />
From the other side of life</p>
